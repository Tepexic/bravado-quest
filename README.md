## Layout design

## Steps

Application is running on a project root (`/`). The sample data to use inside application is taken using an AJAX call from the Star Wars API by [Akabab](https://akabab.github.io/starwars-api).

The default app state contains all profile cards. When user starts typing, the results are filtered in realtime, highlighting the matching string.

## Highlights

- General SPA application performance, including searching, scrolling and highlighting speed.
- Quality of Vue single file components (SFC)
- HTML(JSX) and CSS quality
- JS code quality
- Search should be stateful (using browser url e.g. `/search/Boris`)
- Application should be published online for testing purposes
- Changes should be published in a fork
